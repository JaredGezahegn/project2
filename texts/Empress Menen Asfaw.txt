Haile Selassie's wife, Empress Menen Asfaw, was an important figure in Ethiopian history and a revered figure in her own right.
Full Name: Menen Asfaw

Birth: 1889, in Wollo, Ethiopia

Empress Menen was born into an aristocratic Ethiopian family, linked to the Ethiopian royal lineage. Her father, Asfaw Mikael, was the governor of Wollo and later King of Wollo.

Marriage to Haile Selassie

Menen Asfaw married Ras Tafari Makonnen (later Emperor Haile Selassie I) in 1911.

The marriage was arranged, as was customary in Ethiopian aristocracy, but it reportedly became a strong and supportive union.

Together, they had six children: four daughters and two sons.

Role as Empress

When Haile Selassie became emperor in 1930, Menen was crowned Empress of Ethiopia during his coronation ceremony.

She played a prominent role in supporting her husband's reign, promoting education, religious values, and charitable work.

Empress Menen was deeply involved in church activities and was a devout follower of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. She funded the construction of churches and religious schools across Ethiopia.

Education: Empress Menen was a strong advocate for women's education. She established schools for girls, which was a groundbreaking initiative in Ethiopia at the time.

Charity: She supported various charities and provided aid to the poor, widows, and orphans.

Religious Dedication: She played a key role in the construction of the St. Raguel Church in Addis Ababa and other religious institutions.

During the Italian Invasion (1935–1941)

When Italy invaded Ethiopia in 1935, Haile Selassie and Empress Menen went into exile in Bath, England.

During this difficult period, she remained a source of strength and support for her husband, maintaining Ethiopian unity and pride among exiled communities.

Later Life and Death

Empress Menen continued her charitable and religious work after Ethiopia’s liberation in 1941.

She passed away on February 15, 1962, and was buried in the Holy Trinity Cathedral in Addis Ababa, alongside her husband.

Legacy

Empress Menen is remembered as a strong and compassionate leader, a devout Christian, and a pioneer for women’s education in Ethiopia.

In Rastafarianism, she is honored as a symbol of dignity, strength, and divine feminine power, often referred to as the "Mother of Creation."

Her life and contributions continue to inspire many Ethiopians and followers of Rastafarianism worldwide.
