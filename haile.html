                <h2>Emperor Haile Selassie</h2>
                <p>
                    Haile Selassie was the Emperor of Ethiopia from 1930 to 1974.
                    He is an important figure in Ethiopian and Rastafarian history. <br><br>

                    Born as Tafari Makonnen on July 23, 1892, Haile Selassie rose to power after the death of Empress Zewditu.
                    His coronation name, <span class="text-highlight">"Haile Selassie I"</span>, means "Might of the Trinity" in Amharic. <br><br>

                    During his reign, he championed modernization, abolished slavery, and advocated for Pan-African unity. 
                    His legacy lives on as a symbol of resilience and leadership.

                <h3>Empress Menen Asfaw</h3>
                <p>
                    Empress Menen Asfaw, Haile Selassie's wife, was a strong and revered figure in Ethiopian history.
                    Born into aristocracy, she supported the emperor and played a vital role in Ethiopia's royal legacy.
                    <p>Empress Menen was a devout member of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. She funded and built several churches, 
                    including the Empress Menen Girls’ School, which was one of the first institutions in Ethiopia to provide formal education for young women. 
                    Her commitment to faith and education left a lasting impact on Ethiopia’s society.</p>

                <h3>The Lion Symbol</h3>
                <p>
                    The Lion of Judah, closely associated with Haile Selassie, symbolizes strength and divine authority.
                    It reflects the Solomonic dynasty's lineage and remains an enduring emblem of Ethiopian heritage.
                <p> Ethiopian emperors, including Haile Selassie, 
                    claimed descent from King Solomon and Queen Makeda (Sheba), 
                    making the lion a representation of their divine right to rule.</p>
                <p>
                    The Lion of Judah was a key element of Haile Selassie's royal insignia and 
                    appeared on Ethiopia’s imperial flag before the monarchy was abolished in 1974.

                    <h3>Lulu the Dog</h3>
                    <p>Lulu was the beloved dog of Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia, often seen as a symbol of loyalty and companionship. 
                        <p>The dog gained notable recognition in both Ethiopian history and Rastafarian culture, 
                        where it is cherished as a symbol of the connection between the Emperor and his people. </p>
                        <p>Lulu’s presence with Haile Selassie was more than that of a pet—it represented a bond that transcended the typical relationship between humans and animals, 
                        making the dog a cherished figure in Ethiopian and Rastafarian lore.</p></p>
